## Breadth-first Search (BFS)
- To find the shortest distance between 2 points in graph.
- Questions BFS can answer:
   1. Is there a path from node A to node B?
   2. What is the shortest path from node A to node B? 
  
- Breadth-first search works will radiate out the search  from the starting point, checking first-degree connections before second-degree connections.
- Implemented as queue - that being said, BFS will search the nodes in the order they're added.

### Queues
- First In First Out
- Operations of Queue:
   1. Enqueue: Add item to the end of queue. 
   2. Dequeue: Take item out from the start of queue.
