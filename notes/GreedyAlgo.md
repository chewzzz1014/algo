## Greedy Algorithm
- Steps:
  1. Pick the locally optimal solution at each step.
  2. End up with globally optimal solution.
  
- Simple but don't always give the optimal solution

## Approximation Algorithm
- To cover up for the disadv of Greedy algorithm
- Are judged by how fast they are and how close they are to the optimal solution.
