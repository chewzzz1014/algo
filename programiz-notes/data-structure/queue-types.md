## Types of Queue

---

## Simple Queue
- Insertion at rear(end of queue)
- Removal at front
## Circular Queue
- Last element points to the first element, making a circular link
- Better memory utilization: If the last position is full and first position is empty, insert the element in the first position

## Priority Queue
- Each element is associated with a priority, and is served according to its priority
- If elements with same priority occur, they're served according to their order in queue
- Insertion: Based on arrival of values
- Removal: Based on priority

## Deque (Double Ended Queue)
