## Data Structures Types
- Storage used to store and organize data.
- Linear ds and non-linear ds.
## Linear Data Structure
- Elements arranged in sequence one after the other.
- Not suitable when complexity of prog increases due to operational complexities.
- Array, queue and stack.
## Array 
- Linear ds
- Elements in memory are arranged in continuous memory.
- All elements are same type
## Stack
- Linear ds
- Stored in LIFO principle
## Queue
- Linear ds
- FIFO principle
## Linked List
- Linear ds
- Elements connected through a series of nodes
- Node contains data and address to next node

## Non-Linear Data Structure
- Elements not in any sequence, but in hierarchical where one element connected to one or more elements
- Graph, map and tree.

## Graph 
- Non-Linear ds
- Node = vertex
- Vertex is connected to others vertices thru edges (lines)
- Popular Graph:
  - Spanning Tree & Minumum Spanning Tree
  - Strongly Connected Components
  - Adjacency Matrix
  - Adjacency List
## Tree
- Non-linear ds
- Only one edge between 2 vertices
- Popular Tree:
  - Binary Tree
  - Binary Search Tree
  - AVL Tree
  - B-Tree
  - B+ Tree
  - Red-Black Tree
