## NP-Complete
- Calculate every possible solution and pick the smallest/shortest one
- An problem is NP-Complete if:
  - The algorithm runs quickly with a handful of items but really slows down with more items.
  - The "all combinations of X" problem
  - When calculating "every possible version" of X because can't break down into smaller sub-problems
  - Involve a sequence / set that's hard to solve
  - Can restate the problem as the set-covering problem or the traveling-salesperson problem.
